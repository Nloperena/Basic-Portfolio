    <!-- The content of my bio first paragraph-->

    <p id="p1">Hello, my name is Nicholas, but my friends and collegues call me
        Nico for short. I am an aspiring web developer. I have been searching for
        a career that that would fit my lifestyle while going to college. When I was
        18 I did not know what I wanted with my life, as with most teenagers that age.
        I would idly go through the motions from my jobs and classes in college, until
        one day I stumbled across <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Team Tree House</a>
        where I started to teach myself how to code for the first time.
        <!-- The content of my bio second paragraph -->
        <p id="p2">Ever since then I have wanted to quit my current job to pursue something more meaningful and
            genuinely fun to me.
            There is a sense of accomplishment when going through hurdles and solving problems on my own
            or with friends writing code. Because of this I have signed up for a the UCF Coding Bootcamp
            program and am more ambitous than ever to complete it. Ultimately I want to shape my future to
            be what I want it to be, and something for people to marvel at. Coding is the furture and is the
            reading and writing of our generation.</p>
