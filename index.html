<p>Hello, my name is Nicholas, but my friends and collegues call me
    Nico for short. I am an aspiring web developer. I have been searching for
    a career that that would fit my lifestyle while going to college. When I was
    18 I did not know what I wanted with my life, as with most teenagers that age.
    I would idly go through the motions from my jobs and classes in college, until
    one day I stumbled across <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Team Tree House</a>
    where I started to teach myself how to code for the first time. Ever since then I have
    wanted to quit my current job to pursue something more meaningful and genuinely fun to me.
    There is a sense of accomplishment when going through hurdles and solving problems on my own
    or with friends writing code. Because of this I have signed up for a the UCF Coding Bootcamp
    program and am more ambitous than ever to complete it. Ultimately I want to shape my future to
    be what I want it to be, and something for people to marvel at. Coding is the furture and is the
    reading and writing of our generation.
